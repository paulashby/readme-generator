  ## Description

  A command line node app that generates README markdown files based on user input.<br /><br />One task that's required of a developer for every project is the creation of a quality README file. These files generally follow a fairly predictable structure, so their creation can be automated to streamline this part of the development process.<br /><br />This project does just that and into the bargain, has given me an opportunity to get more familiar with the node inquirer package and some of the nuances of markdown formatting.
