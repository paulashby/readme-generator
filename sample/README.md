  ## Description

  This file is being created purely to demonstrate the README generator command line app, so the remainer of its content is pure fiction, created for demonstration purposes only.
  
  ## Installation
  
  If for any reason you would like to deploy the website yourself, simply fork this repository, go to the Settings page of your fork on GitHub, select <kbd>Pages</kbd> and set the <kbd>Branch</kbd> dropdown to <kbd>main</kbd>.
  
  ## Usage
  
  Visit [the deployed page](https://paulashby.github.io/Weather-Dashboard). If you have granted browser access to your location data, a five day forecast will be loaded for your current region. Else a forecast for London will be loaded as detailed above. Use the search bar to load forecast data for a city of your choice and if available, a five day forecast for this city will be loaded and the location added to your history.
  
  ## Contributing
  
  If you would like to make a contribution to the app, simply fork the respository and submit a Pull Request. If I like it, I may include it in the codebase.
  
  ## Tests
  
  ```node tests```
